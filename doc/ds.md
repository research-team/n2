#NeuroTU main principles

##Main design approach as intro 
Overall architecture is based on ["Model of six"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emotion_Machine)and (H-CogAff)[http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/].
We implement the idea of layered model mapped to neurobiological mechanisms and implemented in neural network (NN). Based on the main crucial for natural NN principles we propose new type of NN capable of:

1. Self-adaptation
     2. Self-training
	 2. Self-recombination
1. Active actions
1. Randomness

##Problem

##Solution principles

###Instinctive/Reactive systems

Reflexes are implemented via reflex arc or **If -> Do** circuits.
This primitive reactions could be translated in to NN and directly coded into neurons.
More complex instincts involves interneurons but still maps into **If -> Do** pattern.

####IF

Analytical part is implemented via 2 mechanisms: polychronisation[Izhicevich], cortical column analytical function.

####Do

Actuator part is implemented via motor neurons.

###Learned reactions subsystems

Learning is implemented via self-training mechanism (Hebbian learning). Memories are emotionally colored and this coloring is used for fast memories retrieval, see Somatic marker hypothesis [@Damasio...]

####Long term associative memory

Associations are build via synchronization mechanism of different brain zones that is implemented by brain waves and association areas of a brain.

###Deliberative thinking

Associations are recombined into logical chains or stories in neuronal circuits trained and build in frontal cortex of a brain.
